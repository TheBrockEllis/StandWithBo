                <h3>Bo Stands By His Players</h3>
                <p>
                    Bo Pelini has grown as a man and as a coach in the past 5 years.
                    He has also helped raise and lead a generation of young men that will
                    become the future leaders of Nebraska and the world. Bo isn't afraid to
                    defend his players just as if they were family.

                <h3>Bo Stands By His Words</h3>
                <p>
                    Bo is an old fashioned guy. He means what he says and says what he means.
                    He is a straight-shooter, often wearing his emotions on his sleeves.
                    His sideline attitude has been criticized by many but he's never been afraid
                    to own up to what he has said.

                <p>
                    Many a Lincoln citizen has seen Bo jogging around campus. He's a normal guy.
                    He embodies the Nebraskan spirit and work ethic. He's been very engaged in
                    local community events and has been instrumental in many young people's lives.
